Count of, and distance to, nearest green space are measured through distance decay and street network, at a range of radii (300m to 5,000m) and green space size (≥ 0.5ha to ≥ 100ha). <br> <strong>Variables used in publications:</strong> <em>gg_2021_all_count_05ha_f_2_300</em> has been created for use in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866724000396?via%3Dihub">Subiza-Perez et al. (2024)</a> to measure residential greeness.
