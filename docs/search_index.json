Contains person level information, such as age, property lived in, number of house moves and data quality indicators. Usage instructions: This is a long dataset, with many rows per participant, and can be used to identify which property and LSOA the participant lived in at a certain age or time point. This can be linked to property level data (including environmental exposures) using “property_id” and LSOA level data using “LSOA11CD” to obtain property/LSOA level data for specific time periods in a particpants life. Data construction: The source data for this table is address strings from monthly searches of the NHS Tracing service (e.g. health care records), which contain limited geographic information and are temporally irregular. To improve the quality of the geographic data, the address strings are passed through the OS Places API, which attempts to match each address string to a geo-located address, providing additional geographic information. Important information on temporal data: This dataset contains data from two separate timelines, which are important to clarify. Temporal variables fixed to the participants age such as age_m are calculated at 6 monthly periods based on date of birth. Separately, address data from NHS tracing services, such as date_address_data_received is received as and when, and may not align with the 6 monthly time periods used to structure the dataset. Where this occurs, address data for some 6 monthly time points has been interpolated from the nearest available data from NHS tracing. The variable is_data_interpolated flags if data has been interpolated, whilst months_to_closest_data_received can be used to assess the temporal difference between the participants age, and the recency of the address data.

The British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS) is a one-to-one test that assesses a child’s receptive vocabulary. For each question, the assessor says a word and the child responds by selecting a picture from four options that best illustrates the word’s meaning. As no reading is required, BPVS can be used to assess language development in non-readers and especially pupils with expressive language impairments. Because no spoken response is required, the assessment may be administered to pupils with autism and other related communication difficulties or those with English as an Additional Language (EAL). To help with administration to pupils who may be colour blind the illustrations have black outlines and the colours are vivid.

Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool (CKAT) is a standardised, computerised assessment battery of visuo-manual motor control which comprises of tasks involving the presentation of interactive visual stimuli displayed on a touch-screen tablet laptop screen, whilst simultaneously recording participant’s responses to these stimuli via interactions with the screen using a handheld stylus. The battery of tasks presented by CKAT is described in detail in Flatters et al. (2014; PloS One, 9(2), e88692. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0088692), whilst the underlying software architecture and the performance metrics CKAT measures participants on are explained in Culmer, Levesley, Mon-Williams and Williams (2009; Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 184(1), 184–92. doi:10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.07.025). To briefly summarise: (1) the CKAT Tracking task assesses participants ability to predict target movement; (2) the Aiming task assesses (discrete) feedforward and feedback control mechanisms and (3) the Tracing/Steering assesses (continuous) steering control mechanisms - all of which are considered to be fundamental sensorimotor control processes.

Contains person level information, such as age, property lived in, number of house moves and data quality indicators. Usage instructions: This is a long dataset, with many rows per participant, and can be used to identify which property and LSOA the participant lived in at a certain age or time point. This can be linked to property level data (including environmental exposures) using “property_id” and LSOA level data using “LSOA11CD” to obtain property/LSOA level data for specific time periods in a particpants life. Data construction: The source data for this table is address strings from monthly searches of the NHS Tracing service (e.g. health care records), which contain limited geographic information and are temporally irregular. To improve the quality of the geographic data, the address strings are passed through the OS Places API, which attempts to match each address string to a geo-located address, providing additional geographic information. Important information on temporal data: This dataset contains data from two separate timelines, which are important to clarify. Temporal variables fixed to the participants age such as age_m are calculated at 6 monthly periods based on date of birth. Separately, address data from NHS tracing services, such as date_address_data_received is received as and when, and may not align with the 6 monthly time periods used to structure the dataset. Where this occurs, address data for some 6 monthly time points has been interpolated from the nearest available data from NHS tracing. The variable is_data_interpolated flags if data has been interpolated, whilst months_to_closest_data_received can be used to assess the temporal difference between the participants age, and the recency of the address data.

Usage instructions: This is a long dataset, with many rows per participant, and can be used to identify which property and LSOA the participant lived in at a certain age or time point. This can be linked to property level data (including environmental exposures) using “property_id” and LSOA level data using “LSOA11CD” to obtain property/LSOA level data for specific time periods in a particpants life. Data construction: The source data for this table is address strings from monthly searches of the NHS Tracing service (e.g. health care records), which contain limited geographic information and are temporally irregular. To improve the quality of the geographic data, the address strings are passed through the OS Places API, which attempts to match each address string to a geo-located address, providing additional geographic information. Important information on temporal data: This dataset contains data from two separate timelines, which are important to clarify. Temporal variables fixed to the participants age such as age_m are calculated at 6 monthly periods based on date of birth. Separately, address data from NHS tracing services, such as date_address_data_received is received as and when, and may not align with the 6 monthly time periods used to structure the dataset.
